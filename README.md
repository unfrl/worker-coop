# Worker Coop proof of concept site!

This is a demo website for the worker coop. For now, it's a single page application (SPA) using [React](https://react.dev/) for UI and [Vite](https://vite.dev/) for building. UI components are using [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/), and internationalization is done with [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) and the react plugin.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have the latest version of [node](https://nodejs.org/en) installed
2. Clone this repo locally and `cd` to the project root
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`

You should be able to open http://localhost:5173/ in a browser and see the site!
